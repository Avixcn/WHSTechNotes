Today, I wrote a paragraph in C.E.R format talking about the new cell phone law.

Personally I believe that the new phone law isnt very needed and that school would be better without it. I belive this because having a phone in school isn't harming the students and some use it for music or when they are done with their work. I am adjusting decent to the new law but I still have the habit of checking my phone often. There are many challenges to not being allowed to use it for example if your chromebook is not working you would be able to use your phone, but now you aren't able to causing some student to be behind on work. Another example of this for the students is if they need to contact home in case of an emergency they would not be able to do so.The last example is if a student needs to take a picture of the work or set an alarm they will get in trouble if caught leading to them forgetting or not being able to catch up.

Today, I explained a way that computer science could be valuable for a career in interested in.

One career i'm interested in is photography and fashion design. Computer science could be valuable in photography because i could possibly learn to edit pictures or videos better. Computer science could be useful in fashion design becuase it could assist me in finding out ways to make designs or try out different ideas I have.

Today, I wrote a paragraph in C.E.R format talking about using AI to solve real world problems.

There are many ways to use AI in the real world in many different categories. Some examples are in education, health, saftey, etc. I believe that one useful way you can use AI responsibly is assisting in education. This can be done by useing AI to help students learn in different ways or help teachers come up with lessons. AI could also be used to help solve problems and explain it in ways that the user could better understand.

Today I wrote a paragraph about if working in a virtual store for real money is a good idea or a bad idea for the future of jobs.

I belive working in a virtual store for real money would be a good idea for many different reasons. One reason i belive this is because people would be able to have a more flexible schedule. They would also be able to work from anywhere as long as they have internet. This would also help with people being late to work because of traffic or other possible issues. Overall being able to work online would be a good idea for many reasons and should be available for more stores around the world.
