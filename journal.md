Today, I wrote a paragraph in C.E.R format talking about the new cell phone law.

Personally I believe that the new phone law isnt very needed and that school would be better without it. I belive this because having a phone in school isn't harming the students and some use it for music or when they are done with their work. I am adjusting decent to the new law but I still have the habit of checking my phone often. There are many challenges to not being allowed to use it for example if your chromebook is not working you would be able to use your phone, but now you aren't able to causing some student to be behind on work. Another example of this for the students is if they need to contact home in case of an emergency they would not be able to do so.The last example is if a student needs to take a picture of the work or set an alarm they will get in trouble if caught leading to them forgetting or not being able to catch up.
