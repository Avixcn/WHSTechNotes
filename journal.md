Today, I wrote a paragraph in C.E.R format talking about the new cell phone law.

Personally I believe that the new phone law isnt very needed and that school would be better without it. I belive this because having a phone in school isn't harming the students and some use it for music or when they are done with their work. I am adjusting decent to the new law but I still have the habit of checking my phone often. There are many challenges to not being allowed to use it for example if your chromebook is not working you would be able to use your phone, but now you aren't able to causing some student to be behind on work. Another example of this for the students is if they need to contact home in case of an emergency they would not be able to do so.The last example is if a student needs to take a picture of the work or set an alarm they will get in trouble if caught leading to them forgetting or not being able to catch up.

Today, I explained a way that computer science could be valuable for a career in interested in.

One career i'm interested in is photography and fashion design. Computer science could be valuable in photography because i could possibly learn to edit pictures or videos better. Computer science could be useful in fashion design becuase it could assist me in finding out ways to make designs or try out different ideas I have.

Today, I wrote a paragraph in C.E.R format talking about using AI to solve real world problems.

There are many ways to use AI in the real world in many different categories. Some examples are in education, health, saftey, etc. I believe that one useful way you can use AI responsibly is assisting in education. This can be done by useing AI to help students learn in different ways or help teachers come up with lessons. AI could also be used to help solve problems and explain it in ways that the user could better understand.

Today I wrote a paragraph about if working in a virtual store for real money is a good idea or a bad idea for the future of jobs.

I belive working in a virtual store for real money would be a good idea for many different reasons. One reason i belive this is because people would be able to have a more flexible schedule. They would also be able to work from anywhere as long as they have internet. This would also help with people being late to work because of traffic or other possible issues. Overall being able to work online would be a good idea for many reasons and should be available for more stores around the world.

Today I explained how technology has changed the holiday

There are many different way the technology has changed how people celebrate holidays. One way is that they are able to connect with family virtually if they are not able to see them in person. I belive that these changes can help make the holiday better because it allows people to hold a stronger connection and be more in touch with people who live far away during the holiday season. I dont belive that the developers should be the ones responsible for respects family time. this is because it all depends on how the user uses the tech. There are many way that people can use tech and still spend quality time with their family such as allowing them to watch or letting them use it with you.

Over the break I had many different ways to access technology one main way was through my phone. I use my phone for many different things but i mainly use it to talk to friends or listen to music. Another way i used technology over the break was through my xbox. I use my xbox to play video games with my friends, watch youtube, etc. I also used technology to watch movies and shows with family.

Safe places are needed on the internet to help prevent bad influences for kids. It is also needed to possibly help people have more fun and not have to worry about others who take things too seriously. Autcraft was designed to create a private mincraft server specifically to be safe and welcoming fo autistic children. This can be used to help Minecraft become a more healthy environment not filled with people who may be disrespectful and might make the expirence not as enjoyable. If developers ignored saftey and inclusion the game may overall get hate from people who may feel left out which might risk the games career as a whole.
